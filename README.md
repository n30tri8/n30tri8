### Ciao!

My name is Pooya. I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at University of Trento. I have experience as a software engineer and tech lead developing web and desktop applications. 

My main research interest lies in understanding, assessing, and improving LLMs through systematic experimentation, optimization, and rigorous evaluation.

My lastest academic projects were focused on LLM-based systems. I designed and implemented pipelines for multilingual benchmarking, pruning, bias detection, and evaluation of implemented techniques.

Besides academia, I enjoy learning about spirituality and non-duality. 

Let's Grow in Life.
