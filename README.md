### Ciao!

My name is Pooya. I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at the University of Trento. I have experience as a software engineer and tech lead, developing web and desktop applications.

My main research interest lies in understanding, assessing, and improving large language models (LLMs) through systematic experimentation, optimization, and rigorous evaluation.

My latest academic projects have focused on LLM-based systems. I designed and implemented pipelines for multilingual benchmarking, model pruning, bias detection, and evaluation of these techniques.

Beyond academia, I enjoy learning about spirituality and non-duality.

Let's grow in life!
